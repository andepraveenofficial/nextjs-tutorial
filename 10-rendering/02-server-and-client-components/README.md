# Server and Client Components

## RSC

- React Server Components
- Server components
- Client components

### RSC + Next.js

- By default, every component in a Next.js app is considered a server component.
- In the RSC architecture and by extension in the Next.js app router, components are server components by default.
- To use client components, you must include the "use client" directive at the top.
- Server components are rendered only on the server
- Client components are rendered once on the server and then on the client.

### Installation
