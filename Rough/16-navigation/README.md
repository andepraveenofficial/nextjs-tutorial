# Navigation

### Link Component Navigation

- To enable client-side navigation Next.js provides us with the Link component.
- The `<Link>` component is a React component that extends the HTML `<a>` element, and it's the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.
- To use it, we need to import it from "next/link".
