## Introduction

- `Next.js` is a React Framework for building web applications.
- Next.js is a framework built on top of React, designed for creating full-featured web applications.
- React alone isnâ€™t enough to build a fully-featured, production-ready application.
- React is a library specifically for building user interfaces.

### NextJS

- NextJS uses React for building user interfaces.
- NextJS provides additional features to help you build production-ready applications.
- These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling, and more.
- Next.js provides all the essential features without needing additional packages.

### Why NextJS

Next.js simplifies the process of building a web application for production

1. Routing: File-based routing for easier navigation.
2. API Routes: Enables writing both frontend and backend code in one framework.
3. Rendering: Supports both client-side and server-side rendering.
4. Data Fetching: Provides built-in methods for fetching data efficiently.
5. Styling
6. Optimization

<summary>Folder Structure</summary>

## Folder Structure

- page.tsx => It is a unique page
- layout.tsx => In the layout.tsx, `children` component always refers to page.tsx

<summary>Components</summary>

## Components

1. Server Components
2. Client Components

### Server Components

- In Next.js, all components are server components by default.
- They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.
- However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions.

### Client Components

- To create a Client component, it's necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file.
- Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.

<summary>Routing</summary>

## Routing

- Next.js has a file-system based routing mechanism
- URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.

### Routing Conventions

- All routes must be placed inside the `app` folder
- Every file that corresponding to a route must be named `page.js` or `page.tsx`
- Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.
- When you run the application and load the route, automatically NextJS creates the `layout.tsx` file
- If route not available NextJS throws 404 NotFound page.

### Types of Routes

1. normal routing
2. nested routing
3. dynamic routing : [productId]
4. nested dynamic routing

<summary>Private Folders</summary>

## Private Folders

- A private folder indicates that it is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system.
- The private folder and all its sub-folders are excluded from routing.
- prefix the folder name with an underscore.

### Advantages

- For separating UI logic from routing logic.
- For consistently organizing internal files across a project.
- For avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file convention.
- If you want to include an underscore in URL segments, you can prefix the folder name with "%5F", which is the URL-encoded from of an underscore.

<summary>Route Groups</summary>

## Route Groups : (folderName)

- To organize your project in a manner that doesn't affect the URL.
- Allows us to logically group our routes and project files without affecting the URL path structure.
- Let's implement authentication routes.

- auth

  - register
  - login
  - forgot-password

- `http://localhost:3000/auth/register`
- `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
- `http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password`

- (auth)

  - register
  - login
  - forgot-password

- `http://localhost:3000/register`
- `http://localhost:3000/login`
- `http://localhost:3000/forgot-password`

<summary>Layouts</summary>

## Layouts

- A page is UI that is unique to a route.
- A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in the app.

### Route Group Layout

- To organize your project in a manner that doesn't affect the URL.
- To selectively apply a layout to certain segment while leaving others unchanged.

<summary>Routing Metadata</summary>

## Routing Metadata

- Ensuring proper search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users.
- Next.js introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata for each page.
- Metadata ensures accurate and relevant information is displayed when your pages are shared or indexed.

### Configuring Metadata

- Export a static metadata object
- Export a dynamic generate Metadata function

### Metadata rules

- Both `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files can export metadata. If defined in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a page, it applies only to that page.
- Metadata is read in order, from the root level down to the final page level.
- when there's metadata in multiple places for the same route, they get combined, but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties

<summary>Navigation</summary>

## Navigation

### Link Component Navigation

- To enable client-side navigation Next.js provides us with the Link component.
- The `<Link>` component is a React component that extends the HTML `<a>` element, and it's the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.
- To use it, we need to import it from "next/link".

### Active Links
